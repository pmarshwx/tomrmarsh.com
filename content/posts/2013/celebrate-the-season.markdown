My latest Christmas CD is finally here!
The CD features new takes on Christmas classics such as "[God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen][3]", "[Winter Wonderland][13]", "[Feliz Navidad][14]", and "[Good Christian Men Rejoice][12]," as well as a few of my favorite renditions from my first CD "[The Joy of Christmas][17]."


### About the Cover Design

When I created the first CD I was given the opportunity to share my love for playing with my daughter’s fourth grade class, and saw firsthand their reaction to my music.
I wanted to include the school that inspired me to compose by asking them to create the cover art for my next CD.
The cover art depicted on the CD was created by one of those students.

### The Story Behind the Music


#### **JINGLE BELLS MEDLEY**
If truth be told, the medley combining "Jingle Bells" with "Here Comes Santa Claus" was actually an accident.
While setting out to record my version of "Jingle Bells" I got a little confused after the first verse and started to play "Here Comes Santa Claus" by mistake.
Instead of stopping and re-recording "Jingle Bells", the medley of the two songs was created.
I guess a lot of great things were the result of mistakes.
And now you know the rest of the story.


#### **CHARLIE BROWN DRUMMER BOY**
I know, who would have thought to combine the famous Charlie Brown theme with "The Little Drummer Boy".
This is not what I originally set out to do as I had previously recorded my rendition of The "Little Drummer Boy".
The night after finishing the recording I had a dream about the drummer boy being played by Charlie Brown.
No wonder, given that as a kid, *Merry Christmas Charlie Brown* was my favorite of all the Charlie Brown specials.
To be honest, I still enjoy the special even today.
There he was, plain as day, good ole Charlie Brown with a drum at his waist secured by a strap around his neck and shoulders playing for little baby Jesus.
In my dream I could hear the Charlie Brown theme being played with the song "The Little Drummer Boy" and the next thing I know I am combining the songs to create what I call "Charlie Brown Drummer Boy".


#### **AULD LANG SYNE**
The phrase "Auld Lang Syne" means "for old times’ sake".
What most people do not know, however, is that there is more than one version of the song.
Most people have only been exposed to the scots poem version, written by Robert Burns in 1788.
This version is most notably referred to as the traditional version.
My daughter, however, pointed out that she recently heard a different version which was a more modern adaptation of the traditional song.
The performer was Mairi Campbell, and after hearing it I decided that I would combine both versions into one.
If you listen very carefully you will notice that the song begins with the traditional version and then moves to the adapted version then back to the traditional version.
Each time the counter version is being simultaneously played in the background.


#### **WALKING IN A WINTER WONDERLAND**
This was a fun song to record.
I wanted to give it a little swagger and decided to introduce a movement which provokes a thought of a young (or young at heart) couple taking a walk down a snow covered country road.
Or perhaps they are riding in a horse drawn carriage while they look at how the homes and barns in their town are decorated for Christmas.
I know that while the song is playing your smile will seem bigger and brighter and your body will start to sway from side to side.
Heck you may even start to sing along.
This song is sure to help you start to celebrate the season.


#### **GOD REST YE MERRY GENTLEMAN**
I always liked this song to be played with a lot of up tempo and powerfully defined rhythms.
This song actually was one of the first songs that I put together when I decided to create the new album.
The percussion changes and string compilations required to obtain the sound were quite challenging, but I am sure that the final rendition will be something that you will enjoy.


#### **IT’S CHRISTMAS TIME**
The inspiration behind this song came from my daughter, Michele, who, when she was much younger, would dress up in her tutu and dance around the living room as though she was a sugarplum fairy.
To provide her some dance accompaniment I would begin to play my own rendition of a song which would remind her of Christmas time, but had the rhythm mimicking something you would hear from the Nutcracker.
I called the song "It’s Christmas Time".
Sit back, close your eyes and relax and you just might see a little ballerina dancing the dance of the sugar plum fairy.


#### **I SAW THREE SHIPS**
This song was recorded as a round descending and ascending through a full octave with key change.
Listen as the counter melodies are used throughout the song to give it an almost echo effect making it seem to be in constant movement.
You can almost picture the three ships sailing on the sea as the song is played.


#### **WE THREE KINGS**
This is a Christmas song more appropriately sung to commemorate the epiphany of our Lord.
I dare to say that this is not a song which first comes to mind when you think of Christmas Carols.
I thought that the song needed to be updated and so I composed this version of the song.
If you listen carefully you will hear the hint of the traditional hymn played by both the Piano and French horn throughout the song, just enough to remind you of the traditional hymn.
This original composition still provides you with the feeling of the Three Kings traveling along dessert terrain on their way to worship the newborn King.


#### **CAROL OF THE BELLS**
Both my daughters, Nikki and Michele, were in their high school choir and part of an ensemble of singers who traveled to various events to perform.
During the Christmas season, they would always enjoy singing this lively and melodic hymn.
To be honest, I have always enjoyed this song and while it was part of my first album "The Joy of Christmas" I just had to include it again on this album.
Listen while the song is played as a round with each pass providing a variation on the classic style of the bells.


#### **GOOD KING WENCESLAS**
Alright I will get right to the point this song is most likely not in everyone’s top ten favorite Christmas hymns of all time.
Most probably because the song's melody is boring to put it bluntly, and the name of the king is hard to pronounce when singing.
I will be the first to admit I had to look up how to spell the name of the King when making the labels for the CD.
(Spell Check!).
I decided to alter the movement and liven up the song while keeping the song as close to traditional as possible.
Listen to the original interlude composition between each verse which I use to keep the song lively and moving without losing the integrity of the traditional song.
I hope you enjoy this lively version of an old classic hymn.


#### **FELIZ NAVIDAD**
Well if this song does not get your feet tapping I do not know what will!
I added this song to the album only after experimenting on the keyboard with various percussion sounds.
When I came to this salsa beat I immediately began to sing the song and the decision was made to add the song.
The song was the last one added to the album.
Listen to the blocks pounding out the beat giving a truly Latin sound to the song, which brings a smile to everyone who hears it and reminds us that no matter what your nationality we all should wish each other a Merry Christmas from the bottom of our hearts and take time to "Celebrate the Season".
