Since the initial release of [Celebrate the Season][3], I felt that something was missing.
Below are two additional songs that I feel go along with the overall theme of the initial CD.
I hope you enjoy!

### The Songs (click song title to listen):

1. [Angels We Have Heard On High][1]
1. [Music Box Hark the Herald Angels Sing][2]

You can listen to the full CD by [clicking here][3]!
