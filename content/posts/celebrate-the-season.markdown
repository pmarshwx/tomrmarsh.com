My latest Christmas CD is finally here!
The CD features new takes on Christmas classics such as “[God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen][3],” “[Winter Wonderland][13]”, [Feliz Navidad][14], and “[Good Christian Men Rejoice][12],” as well as a few of my favorite renditions from my first CD “[The Joy of Christmas][17].”


### About the Cover Design

When I created the first CD I was given the opportunity to share my love for playing with my daughter’s fourth grade class, and saw firsthand their reaction to my music.
I wanted to include the school that inspired me to compose by asking them to create the cover art for my next CD.
The cover art depicted on the CD was created by one of those students.
